# EY09 — The SMRK Hamiltonian — A Renormalized Self-Adjoint Operator

## Overview

This document is part of the Quansistor Field Computing (QFC) compendium.
It develops operator-first foundations for computation, spectral structure,
and arithmetic dynamics within the Quansistor framework.

The focus of this work is conceptual and formal. Results are presented
at the level of operator theory, spectral analysis, and structural constraints.
No physical implementation or performance claims are made.

## Role in the Compendium

This document contributes to:
- the operator-first computational paradigm,
- the spectral and arithmetic program around the SMRK Hamiltonian,
- the formal foundations of Quansistor Field Mathematics.

## Status

Canonical research document.  
Results are definitional, structural, or conjectural as stated.
