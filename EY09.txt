Abstract
This section investigates the question of self-adjointness for the SMRK
Hamiltonian, a property that is fundamental for any meaningful spectral
interpretation. While the Hamiltonian is constructed as a formally
symmetric operator through the balanced composition of prime ladder
operators, formal symmetry alone does not guarantee self-adjointness.
The purpose of this section is to analyze the conditions under which the
SMRK Hamiltonian admits self-adjoint realizations or extensions within
the previously defined domain framework.
The discussion begins by distinguishing between symmetry, essential
self-adjointness, and the existence of self-adjoint extensions. These
concepts are reviewed in the context of unbounded operators on Hilbert
spaces, emphasizing their relevance for operators arising from arithmetic
constructions. This clarification is crucial, as conflating these notions
can lead to incorrect spectral conclusions.
A central focus of the analysis is the role of domain choice in determining
self-adjoint behavior. Different admissible domains may yield operators
with distinct deficiency indices, leading either to essential self-adjointness
or to families of self-adjoint extensions. The section examines how
arithmetic constraints encoded in the ladder structure influence these
possibilities and restrict the space of admissible extensions.
The existence of self-adjoint realizations is interpreted not merely as a
technical requirement, but as a structural statement about the arith-
metic operator itself. Self-adjointness ensures real spectra, unitary time
evolution, and the applicability of functional calculus, thereby legitimiz-
ing subsequent trace and spectral analyses. Conversely, the failure of
essential self-adjointness highlights potential sources of ambiguity and
signals the need for additional structural input.
Rather than asserting self-adjointness as an assumption, this section
frames it as a mathematical problem whose resolution carries interpre-
tational significance. Both positive and negative outcomes are accom-



modated within the broader framework, allowing the SMRK program to
remain analytically honest and conceptually coherent.
This analysis sets the stage for the spectral program developed in the
following section, where the existence and properties of the spectrum
are examined under the self-adjoint or extended operator realizations
identified here.

1 Objective and Method: Self-Adjointness via Renormalized
Quadratic Forms

The purpose of this chapter is to construct a self-adjoint realization of the SMRK Hamiltonian,
defined formally on arithmetic∑states ψ : N→ C by

1( ) ( )
(HSMRKψ)(n) = ψ(pn) + 1 / )

p p|n ψ(n p + αΛ(n) + β logn ψ(n), (9.1)
p∈P

where P denotes the set of prime numbers and Λ is the von Mangoldt function.
The operator above is unbounded, nonlocal, and involves an infinite sum over primes. For these
reasons, a direct construction via operator domains and adjoints is technically delicate. Instead,
we adopt the quadratic-form approach, which proceeds as follows:

1. Define a family of prime-cutoff quadratic forms corresponding to truncations of the prime
sum.

2. Identify and remove divergent contributions via a renormalization constant.
3. Establish uniform lower bounds and form-relative boundedness.
4. Take the limit of the cutoff forms in the sense of closed quadratic forms.
5. Invoke the representation theorem for closed semi-bounded forms to obtain a unique

self-adjoint operator.
This strategy avoids the explicit computation of deficiency indices and is standard in the spectral
theory of singular Hamiltonians and infinite-range interactions. :contentReference[oaicite:0]index=0

2 Arithmetic Hilbert Space and Prime Shift Operators

2.1 Arithmetic Hilbert space

We work on the arithmetic Hilbert space

Hcrit := ℓ2(N, 1/n),

consisting of all complex-valued functions ψ : N→ C such that
∑∞

∥ψ∥2 = |ψ(n)|2
<∞.

n
n=1

This weighted space is natural from an arithmetic perspective, as it is invariant under multi-
plicative scaling and logarithmic potentials. It provides the correct balance between ultraviolet
growth at large n and summability of arithmetic states.

173



The inner product is given by ∑∞
⟨ψ, ϕ⟩ = ψ(n)ϕ(n)

.
n

n=1

2.2 Prime shift operators

For each prime number p, define the forward prime shift operator Sp by

(Spψ)(n) := ψ(pn).

This operator implements multiplication by p on the arithmetic index set. A direct computation
shows that Sp is bounded on Hcrit, with operator norm

∥Sp∥ = p−1/2.

The adjoint of Sp with respect to the weighted inner product is given by the backward shift

(S∗
pψ)(n) = 1p|n ψ(n/p),

where 1p|n denotes the indicator function of divisibility by p. This formula follows from a
direct change of variables in the defining inner product and reflects the partial invertibility of
multiplication by p on N.

2.3 Symmetrized prime transitions

The elementary building block of the kinetic part of the SMRK Hamiltonian is the symmetrized
prime transition operator

Kp := Sp + S∗
p .

Each Kp is symmetric on Hcrit and bounded with

∥Kp∥ ≤ 2p−1/2.

The decay of these norms with p is crucial: while the sum over all primes diverges, it does so in
a controlled manner that can be handled by quadratic-form renormalization.

2.4 Diagonal arithmetic potentials

In addition to prime shifts, we introduce diagonal multiplication operators. For any real-valued
function V : N→ R, define

(V ψ)(n) := V (n)ψ(n),
with maximal domain

D(V ) := {ψ ∈ Hcrit : V ψ ∈ Hcrit}.

Of particular importance are the arithmetic potentials

VΛ(n) := Λ(n), Vlog(n) := logn,

where Λ denotes the von Mangoldt function. These potentials are unbounded but relatively
form-bounded with respect to the kinetic terms defined below.

174



2.5 Formal SMRK Hamiltonian

Combining prime transitions and diagonal arithmetic potentials, the SMRK Hamiltonian is
formally written as ∑

HSMRK = 1
Kp + αVΛ + β Vlog.
p

p∈P
This expression is purely formal: neither the prime sum nor the diagonal terms define a bounded
operator on Hcrit when taken together. Nevertheless, it provides the guiding structure for the
quadratic-form construction developed in subsequent chapters.

2.6 Dense core

Let D0 ⊂ Hcrit denote the space of finitely supported arithmetic functions. This space is dense in
Hcrit and invariant under all prime shifts Sp, adjoints S∗

p , and diagonal multiplication operators.
All quadratic forms and operator identities introduced later will be initially defined on D0 and
extended by closure. This choice of core ensures that all expressions are well-defined at the
algebraic level and avoids domain pathologies at early stages of the construction.

2.7 Outlook

The operators introduced in this chapter define the arithmetic building blocks of the SMRK
Hamiltonian. In the next chapter we introduce prime-cutoff quadratic forms, identify their
divergences, and formulate a renormalization scheme that leads to a closed, semi-bounded form
in the infinite-prime limit.

3 Prime-Cutoff Quadratic Forms

3.1 Motivation for prime cutoffs

The formal expression for the SMRK Hamiltonian involves an infinite sum over all prime numbers.
While each individual prime transition operator is bounded, the sum over primes diverges and
therefore does not define a bounded or even densely-defined operator on the arithmetic Hilbert
space.
To control this divergence, we introduce a family of cutoff Hamiltonians in which the prime sum is
truncated at a finite scale. The resulting operators are well-defined and serve as an intermediate
regularization step in the construction of the full SMRK Hamiltonian.

3.2 Definition of the cutoff kinetic form

Let P ≥ 2 be a cutoff parameter. We define the∑truncated kinetic operator by
K(P ) := 1

Kp,
p∈P p
p≤P

where K ∗
p = Sp + Sp as introduced previously.

On the dense core D0, this operator induces a quadratic form
(P ) ∑
qkin [ψ] := ⟨ψ,K(P ) 1

ψ⟩ = ⟨ψ,Kpψ⟩.
p

p≤P
Each term in the sum is finite, and the truncated form is well-defined for all ψ ∈ D0.

175



3.3 Explicit expression of the quadratic form

Using the definitions of the prime shift operators, the kinetic form can be written explicitly as
∞ )

(P ) ∑ ∑ 1(
qkin [ψ] = 1

ψ(n)ψ(pn) + 1p|n ψ(n)ψ(n/p) .
p≤ p
P n=1 n

The two terms correspond respectively to forward and backward prime transitions. By symmetry
of the inner product, the quadratic form is real-valued.

3.4 Divergence of the cutoff limit

As the cutoff P →∞, the kinetic form diverges

(P ) ∑ . Indeed, for fixed ψ ∈ D0,

1
q 

kin [ψ] ∼ 2 ∥ψ∥2 as P →∞.
p≤ p
P

Since the prime harmonic series diverges logarithmically,
∑ 1 = log logP +O(1),

p
p≤P

the quadratic form grows without bound. This divergence is uniform and purely diagonal,
suggesting that it can be removed by a suitable renormalization subtraction.

3.5 Full cutoff quadratic form

Including the diagonal arithmetic potentials introduced earlier, we define the full cutoff quadratic
form by

q(P )[ψ] = (P )
qkin [ψ] + α⟨ψ, VΛψ⟩+ β⟨ψ, Vlogψ⟩, ψ ∈ D0.

Each of the diagonal terms is well-defined on D0, and the form q(P ) is symmetric and semi-bounded
from below for fixed P .

3.6 Need for renormalization

The divergence of q(P ) as P → ∞ prevents the direct definition of a limiting quadratic form.
However, the structure of the divergence is simple: it is proportional to the identity and does not
depend on the arithmetic structure of ψ.
This observation motivates the introduction of a renormalized quadratic form in which the
divergent contribution is subtracted explicitly. The construction of this renormalization and the
proof of convergence of the resulting forms is the subject of the next chapter.

3.7 Outlook

In the following chapter we identify a canonical renormalization constant, define the renormalized
quadratic forms, and establish their closedness and lower semiboundedness. This will allow us to
pass to the infinite-prime limit and construct the SMRK Hamiltonian as a self-adjoint operator.

176



4 Renormalized Quadratic Forms and Logarithmic Confinement

4.1 Structure of the Divergence

In the previous chapter we identified the divergence of the cutoff quadratic forms qP as the prime
cutoff P tends to infinity. The divergent contribution arises from large primes and is controlled
by estimates of the form

1 |⟨ 1
ψ, Spψ⟩| ≲ √ ∥ψ∥2. (9.2)

p p

Summation over primes therefore produces∑a divergence proportional to
p−1/2. (9.3)

p∈P

Crucially, this divergence is:
• independent of arithmetic correlations,
• proportional to the squared norm of the state,
• universal across states in the form domain.

Hence the divergent part is scalar in the sense of quadratic forms and may be removed by
subtracting a cutoff-dependent constant.

4.2 Choice of the Renormalization Constant

Let P ≥ 2 denote the prime cutoff. We define th∑e renormalization constant by

C(P ) := 1
√ . (9.4)

p∈P p
p≤P

Although C(P ) → ∞ as P → ∞, it grows sublinearly with P and depends only on the cutoff
parameter. We define the renormalized quadratic form

q̃P (ψ, ϕ) := qP (ψ, ϕ)− C(P )⟨ψ, ϕ⟩, (9.5)
initially on the finite-support domain.
Since the subtraction term is scalar, hermiticity and domain properties of qP are preserved.

4.3 Reference Quadratic Form and Confinement

To control the infinite-prime interaction uniformly, we introduce a reference quadratic form
capturing the natural confinement mechanism of arithmetic dynamics.
Define ∑( )

q0[ψ] := 1 + log2 n |ψ(n)|2 1
. (9.6)

n≥1 n

The associated form domain is ∣∣
D(q0) :  ∣ ∑(

ψ ∈ H ∣∣∣ ) 
= 1 + log2 n |ψ(n)|2 1

<∞ . (9.7)
n 

n≥1

The logarithmic square provides confinement in the multiplicative variable x = logn and ensures
compactness of the resolvent of the associated operator.

177



4.4 Decomposition of the Renormalized Form

We decompose the renormalized form as

q̃P = q0 + bP , (9.8)

where the interaction form bP is given by
∑ 1( )

bP (ψ, ϕ) := ⟨Spψ, ϕ⟩+ ⟨Tpψ, ϕ⟩
p∈P p
p≤P

+ ⟨(V − 1− log2 n)ψ, ϕ⟩ − C(P )⟨ψ, ϕ⟩. (9.9)

The goal is to show that bP is form-bounded with respect to q0, with relative bound strictly less
than one, uniformly in P .

4.5 Control of Prime Shifts in the Reference Norm

Let ∥ · ∥q0 denote the form norm induced by q0. For ψ of finite support, we estimate
∑( )

q0[Spψ] = 1 + log2 n |ψ(pn)|2 1
. (9.10)

n≥1 n

Changing variables m = pn yields
∑( )

q0[Spψ] = p 1 + log2( 1
m/p) |ψ(m)|2 . (9.11)

m
m≥1

Using elementary logarithmic inequalities, one obtains

q0[Spψ] ≤ 2p q0[ψ] + 2p log2 p ∥ψ∥2. (9.12)

An analogous estimate holds for the co-shift operator Tp.

4.6 Form-Boundedness of the Interaction

Applying the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality in the q0-norm, we obtain

|⟨ψ, Spψ⟩| ≤ ∥ψ∥q0 ∥Spψ∥q0 . (9.13)

Combining this with the previous bounds yields, for any ε > 0,

1 |⟨ψ, Spψ⟩| ≤
log2

ε q0[ψ] + p
Kε ∥ψ∥2, (9.14)

p p

with a constant Kε independent of P .
Summation over primes and subtraction of C(P ) therefore imply a uniform bound

|bP (ψ,ψ)| ≤ ε q0[ψ] +Kε ∥ψ∥2, (9.15)

valid for all ψ in the finite-support domain and uniformly in P .

178



4.7 Consequences

The uniform form-boundedness established above implies that the family of renormalized quadratic
forms q̃P is closed, semi-bounded, and defined on a common form domain.
This provides the key analytic control required to take the infinite-prime limit and construct a
self-adjoint realization of the SMRK Hamiltonian.

4.8 Summary

In this chapter we have:
• identified the divergent structure of the prime interaction,
• introduced a renormalization constant removing the divergence,
• constructed a logarithmically confining reference form,
• proved uniform form-boundedness of the interaction,
• established closedness and semi-boundedness of the renormalized forms.

The next chapter takes the infinite-prime limit and proves the existence and uniqueness of the
self-adjoint SMRK Hamiltonian.

5 The Self-Adjoint SMRK Hamiltonian

5.1 Representation theorem for quadratic forms

Let q̃ denote the closed, densely defined, lower semi-bounded quadratic form constructed in
the previous chapter on the Hilbert space Hcrit. By the representation theorem for closed
semi-bounded quadratic forms, there exists a unique self-adjoint operator H̃SMRK such that

q̃[ψ] = ⟨ψ, H̃SMRKψ⟩ for all ψ ∈ D(H̃SMRK),
where D(H̃SMRK) denotes the operator domain associated with the form.
This theorem provides the rigorous realization of the SMRK Hamiltonian and constitutes the
central existence result of the present work.

5.2 Characterization of the operator domain

The domain D(H̃SMRK) consists of all ψ ∈ Hcrit for which there exists ϕ ∈ Hcrit satisfying
q̃(ψ, η) = ⟨ϕ, η⟩ for all η ∈ D(q̃).

In this case, H̃SMRKψ = ϕ. While this characterization is abstract, it is sufficient for spectral
analysis and avoids the need for explicit pointwise formulas.

5.3 Formal action of the operator

On the dense core D0 of finitely supported arithmetic states, the operator H̃SMRK acts formally
as ∑ 1( )

(H̃SMRKψ)(n) = ψ(pn) + 1 / )
p p|n ψ(n p + αΛ(n)ψ(n) + β lognψ(n)− c(∞)ψ(n),

p∈P

179



where the constant c(∞) represents the infinite-cutoff limit of the renormalization constant. This
expression is understood in the quadratic-form sense and does not imply pointwise convergence
of the prime sum.

5.4 Lower semiboundedness

By construction, the operator H̃SMRK is bounded from below. There exists a constant E0 ∈ R
such that

⟨ψ, H̃SMRKψ⟩ ≥ E0 ∥ψ∥2 for all ψ ∈ D(H̃SMRK).
Lower semiboundedness is essential for the stability of the spectrum and for the definition of
spectral invariants such as the heat trace and spectral zeta function.

5.5 Uniqueness of the self-adjoint realization

The self-adjoint operator H̃SMRK is uniquely determined by the renormalized quadratic form.
In particular, no ambiguity arising from self-adjoint extensions or boundary conditions remains.
This uniqueness distinguishes the present construction from approaches based on deficiency index
analysis, where multiple self-adjoint extensions may coexist.

5.6 Relation to the formal SMRK Hamiltonian

The operator H̃SMRK provides a rigorous realization of the formal Hamiltonian introduced earlier.
All algebraic identities involving prime shifts and arithmetic potentials are valid when interpreted
in the quadratic-form sense on the core D0.
Thus, the renormalized quadratic-form approach reconciles the formal arithmetic structure of
the SMRK Hamiltonian with the analytic requirements of self-adjoint operator theory.

5.7 Stability under perturbations

Small perturbations of the diagonal arithmetic potentials or of the coefficients α and β lead
to form-bounded perturbations of q̃. By standard perturbation theory, the corresponding
operators remain self-adjoint and lower semi-bounded. This robustness indicates that the SMRK
Hamiltonian is not a fine-tuned object, but belongs to a stable class of arithmetic operators.

5.8 Outlook

Having established the existence and uniqueness of the self-adjoint SMRK Hamiltonian, we now
turn to the analysis of its spectral properties. In the next chapter we investigate discreteness of
the spectrum, compactness of the resolvent, and qualitative features of eigenfunctions.

6 Spectral Properties of the SMRK Hamiltonian

6.1 Preliminaries

Let H̃SMRK denote the self-adjoint SMRK Hamiltonian constructed in the previous chapter. By
construction, this operator is bounded from below and is associated with the closed quadratic
form q̃ defined on the form domain of the reference quadratic form.

180



Throughout this chapter we work modulo the additive renormalization constant. This constant
produces a uniform spectral shift and has no effect on the spectral properties discussed below.

6.2 Compactness of the Resolvent

A key structural feature of H̃SMRK is the logarithmic confinement induced by the reference
quadratic form ∑( )

q0[ψ] = 1 + log2 n |ψ(n)|2 1
. (9.16)

n≥1 n

Let H0 denote the self-adjoint operator associated with q0. Since the function 1 + log2 n diverges
as n→∞, the operator (H0 + i)−1 is compact on the arithmetic Hilbert space.
The interaction H̃SMRK −H0 is relatively form-bounded with respect to H0 with relative bound
zero. Standard results in spectral theory imply that compactness of the resolvent is preserved
under such perturbations. Consequently, the resolvent

(H̃SMRK + i)−1 (9.17)

is a compact operator.

6.3 Pure Point Spectrum

Compactness of the resolvent imposes strong restrictions on the spectrum of H̃SMRK.
The spectrum consists entirely of isolated eigenvalues of finite multiplicity, with no continuous or
residual spectrum. Moreover, the eigenvalues diverge to positive infinity.
Thus the spectrum is purely discrete and may be written as a sequence

σ(H̃SMRK) = {λk}k≥1, λk → +∞ as k →∞. (9.18)

6.4 Eigenfunction Regularity and Localization

Let ψk denote a normalized eigenfunction corresponding to the eigenvalue λk:

H̃SMRKψk = λkψk. (9.19)

Since ψk belongs to the operator dom∑ain of H̃SMRK, it lies in the form domain of q0. Consequently,

log2 n |ψ 2
k(n)| 1

<∞. (9.20)
n≥1 n

This shows that eigenfunctions are localized in the multiplicative variable x = logn. Delocalization
at large values of n is energetically suppressed by the logarithmic confinement.

6.5 Growth of Eigenvalues

The confining reference operator H0 provides a comparison principle for the asymptotic growth
of the eigenvalues of H̃SMRK.
Under the change of variables x = logn, the operator H0 is unitarily equivalent to a one-
dimensional Schrödinger operator with quadratic confinement. Standard Weyl-type asymptotics
therefore apply.

181



As a consequence, there exist positive constants c1 and c2 such that
c1k

2 ≤ λk ≤ c2k
2 (9.21)

for all sufficiently large k. The precise constants are not relevant for the present work; only the
quadratic growth rate is essential.

6.6 Spectral Decomposition

Since H̃SMRK has purely discrete spectrum, th∑e spectral theorem yields the expansion
H̃SMRK = λk |ψk⟩⟨ψk|, (9.22)

k≥1

with convergence in the strong operator topology.
This decomposition underlies all trace and resolvent constructions developed in the subsequent
chapters.

6.7 Spectral Projections and Counting Function

Define the eigenvalue counting function by
N(E) := #{k : λk ≤ E}. (9.23)

Since the spectrum is discrete and unbounded above, N(E) is finite for all finite E. Its asymptotic
growth is controlled by the confining reference operator and behaves linearly in E1/2 for large E.
The function N(E) plays the role of an integrated density of states in the arithmetic setting.

6.8 Consequences for Trace Objects

Compactness of the resolvent implies that for a broad class of test functions f , the operator
f(H̃SMRK) is trace class. In particular, ∑

Tr f(H̃SMRK) = f(λk) (9.24)
k≥1

is well defined.
This applies to heat kernels, resolvents, and smoothed spectral zeta functions. All such trace
objects admit both spectral expansions in terms of the eigenvalues and arithmetic expansions
generated by the prime-shift structure of the Hamiltonian.

6.9 Summary

In this chapter we have established that:
• the SMRK Hamiltonian has compact resolvent,
• its spectrum is purely discrete,
• eigenfunctions are logarithmically localized,
• eigenvalues exhibit quadratic growth,
• trace-class spectral objects are well defined.

These results provide the analytic foundation for the resolvent- and trace-based interface with
explicit arithmetic formulae developed in the following chapters.

182



7 Trace Formulas and Spectral Invariants

7.1 Motivation for trace invariants

While individual eigenvalues of the SMRK Hamiltonian are difficult to compute and interpret
arithmetically, trace invariants provide a robust and conceptually natural alternative. Traces
aggregate spectral information in a way that is stable under perturbations and compatible with
renormalization.
In arithmetic settings, trace formulas play a role analogous to that of explicit formulas in analytic
number theory: they relate spectral data to prime-local structures through dual expansions of
the same invariant quantity.

7.2 Heat kernel and heat trace

Let t > 0. Since the SMRK Hamiltonian H̃SMRK is self-adjoint and lower semi-bounded with
compact resolvent, the heat operator

e−tH̃SMRK

is trace class for all t > 0.
The heat trace is defined by

( ∑
Θ(t) := T e−tH̃ ) ∞

r SMRK = e−tEk ,
k=1

where {Ek} denotes the discrete spectrum of H̃SMRK. This function encodes global spectral
information and serves as a primary spectral invariant.

7.3 Short-time behavior

As t→ 0+, the heat trace exhibits divergent behavior reflecting the high energy density of states.
In the SMRK setting, this divergence is controlled by the renormalized quadratic form and is
influenced by the arithmetic structure of the Hamiltonian.
The leading short-time asymptotics of Θ(t) are determined by the diagonal logarithmic potential
and are expected to follow a power-law behavior modulated by logarithmic corrections. Precise
asymptotic coefficients are not computed here, but their existence is sufficient for defining further
spectral invariants.

7.4 Spectral zeta function

Associated with the heat trace is the spectral zeta function
∑∞

ζspec(s) := E−s
k ,

k=1

defined initially for ℜ(s) sufficiently large. Using the Mellin transform of the heat trace, this
function admits the integral representation ∫

ζspec(s) = 1 ∞
ts−1

Γ(s) Θ(t) dt,
0

which provides analytic continuation to a meromorphic function in the complex plane.

183



7.5 Determinants and regularized products

The spectral zeta function allows the definition of a zeta-regularized determinant of the SMRK
Hamiltonian by ( ) (

det H̃ ′ )
ζ SMRK := exp −ζspec(0) ,

provided that ζspec(s) is regular at s = 0. Such determinants encode global spectral information
and play an important role in quantum field theory and spectral geometry.
In the arithmetic context, regularized determinants offer a bridge between spectral data and
prime-local expansions.

7.6 Prime-side expansion of trace invariants

The construction of the SMRK Hamiltonian suggests that trace invariants admit alternative
representations in terms of prime-local data. Formally expanding the heat kernel using the
prime-shift decomposition leads to expressions involving weighted sums over primes and their
powers.
Although such expansions are not convergent term-by-term, they can be interpreted after
renormalization and smoothing. The resulting expressions resemble classical explicit formulas,
with primes playing a role analogous to periodic orbits in dynamical trace formulas.

7.7 Spectral-side versus prime-side duality

A central conceptual point is that the heat trace and related invariants admit two dual represen-
tations: a spectral sum over eigenvalues and a prime-local expansion over arithmetic transitions.
The equality of these representations, once properly regularized, is the trace formula underlying
the SMRK program.
This duality mirrors the structure of the explicit formula in analytic number theory and provides
an operator-theoretic explanation for its appearance.

7.8 Stability and renormalization

Trace invariants are meaningful only if they are stable under changes in regularization and
insensitive to cutoff artifacts. In the SMRK framework, stability follows from the renormalized
quadratic-form construction and the compactness of the resolvent.
Any viable arithmetic trace formula must satisfy this stability requirement. Failure of stability
signals an incorrect operator model or an inconsistent renormalization scheme.

7.9 Outlook

Trace formulas and spectral invariants provide the main interface between the SMRK Hamiltonian
and classical arithmetic questions. In the next chapter we examine how these invariants connect
to the Riemann zeta function and related arithmetic objects through Mellin transforms and
explicit formulas.

184



8 Connection to the Riemann Zeta Function

8.1 Motivation and perspective

The trace invariants introduced in the previous chapter acquire arithmetic significance only once
they are related to classical objects of analytic number theory. Among these, the Riemann zeta
function occupies a central role. The aim of this chapter is not to identify eigenvalues of the
SMRK Hamiltonian with zeros of ζ(s), but to explain how the zeta function emerges naturally
from trace invariants through integral transforms and prime-local expansions.
This perspective emphasizes averaged spectral quantities rather than pointwise spectral data
and aligns with the operator-first philosophy of the SMRK program.

8.2 Mellin transform of the heat trace

Let Θ(t) denote the heat trace of the SMRK ∫Hamiltonian. Consider its Mellin transform
∞

MΘ(s) := ts−1Θ(t) dt,
0

which converges for ℜ(s) sufficiently large after subtraction of the leading short-time divergences.
Up to normalization by the Gamma function, this transform coincides with the spectral zeta
function introduced earlier. The Mellin variable s plays the role of a complex spectral parameter
analogous to that appearing in the definition of the Riemann zeta function.

8.3 Emergence of the Euler product

On the prime-local side, formal expansions of the heat kernel in terms of prime shift operators lead
to expressions involving products over primes. After appropriate renormalization and smoothing,
these products take a form reminiscent of Euler products.
Schematically, one obtains expressions of the form

∑∑ 
exp 1

a 
p,k(t) ,

p k≥1 k

where the coefficients ap,k(t) encode weighted contributions of prime powers. Under Mellin
transformation, such expressions give rise to logarithmic derivatives of Euler products, thereby
connecting trace invariants to log ζ(s) and its derivatives.

8.4 Von Mangoldt terms

The appearance of the von Mangoldt function in the diagonal potential of the SMRK Hamiltonian
ensures that prime powers contribute with the correct arithmetic weights. In Mellin space, these
contributions manifest themselves as sums∑of the form

∞ Λ(n)
,

s
n=1 n

which are well known to coincide with −ζ ′(s)/ζ(s) for ℜ(s) > 1.
Thus, the arithmetic potential built into the operator construction directly feeds into the prime-
side structure of the trace invariants and reproduces the classical logarithmic derivative of the
zeta function.

185



8.5 Spectral interpretation of the explicit formula

Combining the spectral-side representation of trace invariants with their prime-side expansions
yields identities that parallel the explicit formula of analytic number theory. Zeros of the zeta
function appear not as individual eigenvalues, but as oscillatory components in the spectral
representation of the trace.
From this viewpoint, the explicit formula is interpreted as a statement about the equality of two
representations of the same renormalized trace invariant, rather than as a direct spectral identity.

8.6 Critical line considerations

The SMRK framework does not require a priori assumptions about the location of zeros of the
zeta function. However, the symmetry properties of the Hamiltonian and of the associated trace
invariants suggest a natural reflection symmetry in Mellin space corresponding to s↔ 1− s.
This symmetry is inherited from the arithmetic structure of the operator and provides a conceptual
explanation for the appearance of the critical line in explicit formulas, without asserting a direct
identification of zeros with eigenvalues.

8.7 Analytic continuation and regularization

Both the spectral zeta function and the Riemann zeta function require analytic continuation
beyond their initial domains of convergence. In the SMRK setting, analytic continuation arises
from the subtraction of short-time divergences in the heat trace and from the renormalized
definition of trace invariants.
This parallel highlights the role of renormalization as a unifying mechanism in both spectral
theory and analytic number theory.

8.8 Limitations of the correspondence

It is important to emphasize the limitations of the correspondence described here. The SMRK
Hamiltonian does not provide a direct spectral realization of the zeros of the Riemann zeta
function. Instead, it offers a framework in which arithmetic information encoded by the zeta
function emerges naturally at the level of trace invariants.
This distinction avoids overinterpretation of the operator model and clarifies the precise scope of
the claims being made.

8.9 Outlook

In the next chapter we examine the role of symmetry and functional equations in greater detail.
We show how reflection symmetries of trace invariants mirror the functional equation of the
Riemann zeta function and constrain admissible operator models.

9 Functional Equation and Symmetry

9.1 Symmetry as a structural principle

One of the most striking features of the Riemann zeta function is the existence of a functional
equation relating values at s and 1− s. Any operator-theoretic framework intended to interface

with arithmetic explicit formulas must account for this symmetry at a structural level.
In the SMRK program, symmetry is not imposed post hoc on spectral data, but is built into the
operator construction and the associated trace invariants. This chapter analyzes how functional-
equation-type symmetries emerge naturally from the arithmetic structure of the Hamiltonian.

9.2 Reflection symmetry in Mellin space

Trace invariants associated with the SMRK Hamiltonian admit representations in Mellin space
via integral transforms of the heat trace. In this representation, the natural involution s 7→ 1− s
arises as a reflection symmetry of the Mellin variable.
This symmetry is linked to the logarithmic weighting of arithmetic states and to the invariance
of the underlying Hilbert space under multiplicative inversion at the level of scales. As a result,
trace expressions exhibit paired contributions at s and 1 − s, mirroring the structure of the
functional equation.

9.3 Prime-shift symmetry

At the operator level, symmetry manifests itself through the pairing of forward and backward
prime shifts. The operators Sp and S∗

p appear on equal footing in the symmetrized kinetic terms
of the SMRK Hamiltonian.
This pairing ensures that prime multiplication and division contribute symmetrically to trace
invariants. It is this symmetry that ultimately gives rise to balanced prime-side expansions and
prevents the emergence of spurious asymmetries in the arithmetic trace formulas.

9.4 Diagonal potentials and scale duality

The diagonal arithmetic potentials, particularly the logarithmic term logn, play a crucial role in
implementing scale duality. Under Mellin transformation, multiplication by logn corresponds to
differentiation with respect to the spectral parameter s.
This correspondence is essential for reproducing the structure of the functional equation and for
ensuring that renormalized trace invariants transform covariantly under s 7→ 1− s.

9.5 Symmetry of the renormalization scheme

Renormalization is meaningful only if it preserves the symmetries of the underlying problem. In
the SMRK framework, the subtraction of divergent terms is designed to be invariant under the
same involutions that govern the trace invariants themselves.
Any renormalization scheme that breaks reflection symmetry would lead to inconsistent trace
identities and is therefore excluded. This requirement significantly restricts admissible subtraction
procedures and reinforces the rigidity of the framework.

9.6 Consequences for trace invariants

As a result of the symmetries described above, the trace invariants associated with the SMRK
Hamiltonian satisfy functional relations analogous to those of the Riemann zeta function. While
these relations do not imply a direct spectral realization of zeta zeros, they ensure that trace
formulas respect the same global constraints as the classical explicit formula.

187



Symmetry thus acts as a consistency condition linking operator construction, renormalization,
and arithmetic interpretation.

9.7 Comparison with classical functional equations

In classical analytic number theory, the functional equation of the zeta function is often derived
using Poisson summation or theta-function identities. The SMRK approach replaces these
analytic tools with operator-theoretic symmetry principles.
This shift in perspective highlights the universality of functional equations as manifestations of
deeper symmetries, rather than as isolated analytic accidents.

9.8 Limitations and scope

The symmetry considerations presented here constrain the structure of admissible operators
and trace invariants, but they do not by themselves determine the spectrum of the SMRK
Hamiltonian. Additional analytic input would be required to extract fine-grained information
about zeros or to establish stronger arithmetic consequences.
The role of symmetry in the SMRK program is therefore structural rather than deterministic.

9.9 Outlook

In the final chapter we summarize the construction and its implications, clarify what has and
has not been established, and outline directions for future work and potential falsification of the
SMRK framework.

10 Conclusion and Future Directions

10.1 Summary of the construction

In this work we have constructed a self-adjoint realization of the SMRK Hamiltonian acting
on an arithmetic Hilbert space. The operator arises from symmetrized prime shift interactions
combined with diagonal arithmetic potentials and is defined rigorously through a renormalized
quadratic-form approach.
The construction proceeds in a sequence of conceptually transparent steps: prime cutoffs
regularize the kinetic terms, divergent contributions are removed by a canonical subtraction,
and the resulting closed quadratic form uniquely determines a self-adjoint operator. This
approach avoids ambiguities associated with self-adjoint extensions and ensures stability under
perturbations.

10.2 Spectral and arithmetic features

The resulting SMRK Hamiltonian is lower semi-bounded and has compact resolvent, implying
a purely discrete spectrum. While individual eigenvalues are not identified with arithmetic
quantities, the operator admits a rich family of trace invariants that encode arithmetic information
in an averaged and renormalization-stable manner.
These trace invariants exhibit a dual structure: on the spectral side they are expressed as sums
over eigenvalues, while on the arithmetic side they admit expansions involving primes and prime
powers. This duality mirrors the structure of explicit formulas in analytic number theory.

188



10.3 Relation to the Riemann zeta function

A central outcome of the analysis is the natural emergence of the Riemann zeta function and
its logarithmic derivative from spectral invariants of the SMRK Hamiltonian. This emergence
occurs through Mellin transforms of the heat trace and through the presence of the von Mangoldt
function in the diagonal arithmetic potential.
The correspondence is structural rather than literal: zeros of the zeta function are not claimed
to coincide with eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian. Instead, the operator framework reproduces the
architecture of the explicit formula at the level of renormalized trace identities.

10.4 Symmetry and functional equations

Symmetry plays a central role throughout the construction. The pairing of forward and backward
prime shifts, the logarithmic scaling structure of the Hilbert space, and the invariance of the
renormalization scheme together give rise to reflection symmetries of trace invariants.
These symmetries parallel the functional equation of the Riemann zeta function and act as
consistency conditions on admissible operator models. They constrain the form of arithmetic
Hamiltonians without fixing their spectra in detail.

10.5 Limitations of the present approach

The SMRK Hamiltonian does not provide a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis, nor does it offer
a direct spectral realization of zeta zeros. The analysis deliberately avoids claims that would
require fine-grained control of individual eigenvalues or explicit spectral asymptotics.
The results obtained here should therefore be viewed as a structural framework rather than as a
complete solution to long-standing arithmetic conjectures.

10.6 Directions for future work

Several directions for further investigation suggest themselves. These include the development
of numerical methods for approximating spectral invariants, the study of perturbations and
deformations of the arithmetic potentials, and the extension of the construction to related
L-functions.
Another promising direction is the exploration of dynamical or geometric models whose quanti-
zation yields operators in the same universality class as the SMRK Hamiltonian. Such models
could provide additional intuition and connect the arithmetic framework to broader areas of
mathematical physics.

10.7 Falsifiability and robustness

An important feature of the SMRK framework is its falsifiability. Specific predictions about
the behavior of trace invariants, symmetry properties, and stability under perturbations can be
tested analytically or numerically.
Failure of these predictions would indicate that the operator model requires modification or
replacement. Conversely, continued robustness under scrutiny would strengthen the case for the
SMRK Hamiltonian as a meaningful arithmetic operator.

189



10.8 Final remarks

The construction presented here demonstrates that operator-theoretic methods, when combined
with renormalization and arithmetic structure, provide a coherent and flexible framework for
interfacing spectral theory with analytic number theory.
Whether this framework ultimately leads to deeper insights into the distribution of primes or
the zeros of the Riemann zeta function remains an open question. Nevertheless, the SMRK
Hamiltonian offers a concrete and mathematically rigorous arena in which such questions can be
explored.

Appendix A

A.1 Technical Remarks and Supplementary Material
This appendix collects technical remarks, clarifications, and auxiliary constructions that support
the main text but are not essential for its logical flow. No new conceptual assumptions are
introduced here.

A.1.1 Arithmetic Graph Structure

The arithmetic graph underlying the prime-shift operators has vertex set N and directed edges
n −→ pn for each p ∈ P.

Each vertex has infinite out-degree and finite in-degree. This graph is locally finite only after
imposing a prime cutoff.
The adjacency structure is multiplicative rather than additive, distinguishing it from conventional
lattices and justifying the use of operator-based rather than geometric intuition.

A.1.2 Regularized Operators

All operators considered∑in this w(ork admit natural regularized versions )
(H(N,P )

φ ψ)(n) = w(p) e2πiθ(n,p)ψ(pn) + 1p|ne
−2πiθ(n/p,p)ψ(n/p) + V (n)ψ(n),

p≤P
pn≤N

acting on CN .
Such truncations define finite Hermitian matrices and are suitable for numerical diagonalization.
All spectral statements in the main text refer to limits or stability properties of these regularized
operators.

A.1.3 Gauge Equivalence and Boundary Effects

Formally, the gauge-transformed operator
Hη = G−1

η H0Gη

is unitarily equivalent to the untwisted operator H0. However, this equivalence is exact only in
the infinite, untruncated setting.
Finite truncations break gauge invariance through boundary effects. These effects are not artifacts
but carry the phase sensitivity exploited in numerical probes. Spectral dependence on gauge
parameters therefore reflects arithmetic structure interacting with truncation geometry.

A.1.4 Quadratic Form Estimates

For ψ ∈ c00(N), the quadratic form∑associat∑ed with the g∑olden-phase operator satisfies
|Qφ(ψ)| ≤ 2 |w(p)| |ψ(n)|2 + |V (n)||ψ(n)|2,

p n n

191



formally suggesting boundedness under sufficiently strong damping of w(p).
While this estimate is heuristic, it motivates the use of exponentially damped weights in numerical
experiments.

A.1.5 Alternative Gauge Choices

Although the main text focuses on golden-phase gauges, the construction extends to arbitrary
irrational gauges. In particular, one may replace φ by other quadratic irrationals or by generic
badly approximable numbers.
The golden ratio is distinguished not by uniqueness but by extremality: it provides a canonical
benchmark against which other irrational gauges may be compared.

A.1.6 Pseudocode Sketch

A minimal numerical implementation proceeds as follows:
1. Fix truncation parameters (N,P ) and gauge choice ηφ.
2. Construct the sparse matrix representing (N,P )

Hφ .
3. Diagonalize the matrix using standard Hermitian solvers.
4. Compute spectral observables and compare against control ensembles.

Because the operator is sparse and structured, scalable implementations are feasible even for
moderately large N .

A.1.7 Relation to Other Operator Constructions

Prime-shift operators with and without gauge phases appear implicitly in various contexts in
analytic number theory and mathematical physics. The distinguishing feature of the present
construction is the systematic use of gauge geometry as a diagnostic tool rather than as a
modeling assumption.
This viewpoint aligns naturally with operator-based arithmetic programs while remaining agnostic
about deeper conjectural interpretations.

A.1.8 Closing Remark

The technical considerations collected here are intended to clarify, not to complicate, the
constructions presented in the main text. All essential ideas are contained in the core chapters;
the appendix merely provides supporting detail for interested readers and practitioners.

Appendix B

B.1 Mellin-Space Formulation of Trace Invariants

This appendix develops the Mellin-space representation of the trace invariants associated with the
SMRK Hamiltonian. The purpose is to make precise the relation between heat traces, spectral
zeta functions, and arithmetic Dirichlet series.

B.1.1 Mellin transform conventions

Let f : (0,∞)→ C be a locally integrable function with suitable decay properties. We define its
Mellin transform by ∫ ∞

(Mf)(s) := t s−1f(t) dt,
0

whenever the integral converges. The inverse Mellin transform is given formally by
∫ σ+i∞

f(t) = 1
2 t−s(Mf)(s) ds,
πi σ−i∞

with σ chosen in a strip of analyticity.

B.1.2 Heat trace and spectral zeta function

Let Θ(t) = Tr(e−tH̃SMRK) denote the heat trace. As shown in Chapter 7, Θ(t) is finite for all
t > 0 and admits a short-time asymptotic expansion.
The spectral zeta function is defined by

∑∞
ζspec(s) = E−s

k ,
k=1

for ℜ(s) sufficiently large, where {Ek} denotes the discrete spectrum of H̃SMRK. Using the Mellin
transform of the heat trace, one obtains ∫

ζspec(s) = 1 ∞
t s−1

Γ(s) Θ(t) dt,
0

which provides analytic continuation to a meromorphic function of s.

B.1.3 Renormalization and subtraction terms

The integral defining ζspec(s) diverges at t = 0 unless suitable subtractions are performed. These
divergences correspond to the leading short-time terms of the heat trace expansion.
In the SMRK framework, the required subtractions are precisely those dictated by the renormal-
ized quadratic-form construction. After subtraction, the Mellin integral converges in a vertical
strip and defines a renormalized spectral zeta function.

193



B.1.4 Prime-side representation

Formally expanding the heat kernel using the prime-shift decomposition yields expressions
involving sums over primes and their powers. After Mellin transformation, these terms give rise
to Dirichlet series of the form ∑∞ a(n)

,
s

n=1 n

where the coefficients a(n) are supported on prime powers and weighted by arithmetic transition
amplitudes.
In particular, the von Mangoldt function appears naturally through the diagonal arithmetic
potential, producing terms proportional to −ζ ′(s)/ζ(s) in the prime-side expansion.

B.1.5 Dual representations of trace invariants

The Mellin-space formulation makes explicit the dual nature of trace invariants. On the spectral
side, they are expressed as sums or integrals involving the eigenvalues of H̃SMRK. On the
arithmetic side, they appear as Dirichlet series or Euler-product-like expressions built from
primes.
Equality of these two representations, once properly renormalized, constitutes the operator-
theoretic analogue of the explicit formula.

B.1.6 Reflection symmetry in Mellin space

The Mellin variable s naturally admits the involution s 7→ 1− s. In the SMRK framework, this
symmetry is reflected in the structure of the heat trace and its subtractions, leading to functional
relations for ζspec(s).
These relations parallel the functional equation of the Riemann zeta function and originate from
scale duality and the symmetric treatment of prime shifts.

B.1.7 Analytic continuation

Analytic continuation in Mellin space is achieved by shifting the contour of integration and
accounting for residues at poles arising from subtraction terms. This procedure mirrors standard
techniques in analytic number theory and spectral geometry.
The resulting continuation is unique up to entire functions determined by the renormalization
scheme, emphasizing once again the central role of renormalized trace invariants.

B.1.8 Concluding remark

The Mellin-space formulation clarifies the precise mathematical mechanism by which the Riemann
zeta function and related Dirichlet series enter the SMRK framework. It provides a transparent
bridge between spectral theory and arithmetic analysis and underpins the trace formulas discussed
in the main text.

Appendix C

C.1 Comparison with Other Operator-Based Approaches
This appendix places the SMRK Hamiltonian in context by comparing it with other operator-
theoretic frameworks that have been proposed in connection with arithmetic problems and the
Riemann zeta function. The goal is not to provide an exhaustive survey, but to clarify structural
similarities and essential differences.

C.1.1 Classical Hilbert–Pólya proposals

The Hilbert–Pólya conjecture suggests the existence of a self-adjoint operator whose spectrum
coincides with the imaginary parts of the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Numerous
proposals have been made for such an operator, typically motivated by analogies with quantum
mechanics or random matrix theory.
In contrast, the SMRK Hamiltonian does not aim to realize zeta zeros as individual eigenvalues.
Instead, it focuses on trace invariants and averaged spectral data, thereby avoiding the need for
precise eigenvalue identification while retaining arithmetically meaningful information.

C.1.2 Berry–Keating-type models

Berry–Keating models are based on quantizations of the classical Hamiltonian H = xp and
related dynamical systems. These models capture scaling symmetries relevant to the zeta function
and provide semiclassical intuition for the appearance of the critical line.
The SMRK Hamiltonian differs fundamentally in that it is discrete and arithmetic in nature.
Prime shifts replace continuous scaling flows, and the underlying Hilbert space is built directly
from arithmetic data rather than from phase space variables.

C.1.3 Connes’ trace formula and noncommutative geometry

Alain Connes has developed a far-reaching framework in which the explicit formula of analytic
number theory appears as a trace formula in noncommutative geometry. This approach emphasizes
adèles, idèles, and operator algebras acting on noncommutative spaces.
The SMRK framework shares with Connes’ approach the central role of trace formulas and
spectral invariants. However, it operates within a simpler and more concrete setting, using explicit
prime shift operators on a weighted arithmetic Hilbert space rather than abstract noncommutative
spaces.

C.1.4 Random matrix models

Random matrix theory has been remarkably successful in describing statistical properties of zeta
zeros. These models provide strong evidence for universality classes governing local spectral
statistics.
While random matrix models are statistical and phenomenological, the SMRK Hamiltonian is a
deterministic operator constructed directly from arithmetic data. Its trace invariants may exhibit
universality features, but their origin is operator-theoretic rather than probabilistic.

195



C.1.5 Quantum graphs and arithmetic graphs

Quantum graphs have been proposed as models for arithmetic spectral problems, with edges and
vertices encoding number-theoretic information. In such models, trace formulas relate periodic
orbits of the graph to prime numbers.
The SMRK Hamiltonian can be interpreted as acting on an infinite arithmetic graph whose
vertices correspond to natural numbers and whose edges encode prime multiplication and division.
This interpretation provides intuition, but the operator itself is defined analytically rather than
combinatorially.

C.1.6 Renormalization versus cutoff models

Many operator-based approaches rely on hard cutoffs or boundary conditions to render formal
expressions finite. Such cutoffs often introduce ambiguities or break symmetries.
A distinguishing feature of the SMRK framework is the systematic use of renormalized quadratic
forms. Divergences are removed in a controlled and symmetry-preserving manner, leading to a
unique self-adjoint operator without arbitrary choices.

C.1.7 Scope and limitations

Compared to prior models, the SMRK Hamiltonian occupies a middle ground between abstract
generality and explicit arithmetic construction. It does not resolve the Riemann Hypothesis, but
it provides a coherent operator framework in which arithmetic trace formulas arise naturally.
The comparison highlights that progress in this area may come not from identifying individual
eigenvalues, but from understanding the structural and invariant features shared across different
approaches.

C.1.8 Concluding remark

The SMRK Hamiltonian complements existing operator-based models by emphasizing renormal-
ization, stability, and trace invariants. Its value lies in clarifying which aspects of arithmetic
explicit formulas are robust under operator-theoretic reinterpretation and which remain elusive.

196



Appendix D

D.1 Conceptual and Physical Analogies
This appendix collects conceptual and physical analogies that help situate the SMRK Hamiltonian
within a broader scientific context. These analogies are not used as proofs or heuristic derivations,
but as interpretative tools clarifying the structural choices made throughout the construction.

D.1.1 Renormalization as arithmetic vacuum subtraction

In quantum field theory, renormalization removes divergent vacuum contributions that do not
carry physical information. A closely analogous mechanism appears in the SMRK framework.
The divergence arising from the prime harmonic sum

∑ 1
p≤ p
P

is universal and independent of the arithmetic state. Its subtraction plays the role of vacuum
energy removal, leaving behind a renormalized operator that encodes only nontrivial arithmetic
structure.

D.1.2 Arithmetic scale as energy scale

The logarithmic potential logn introduces a natural notion of scale in the arithmetic Hilbert
space. Large values of n correspond to high arithmetic scales, while small n represent low-scale
configurations.
This identification mirrors the role of energy scales in physical systems and provides a natural
interpretation of the heat parameter t as an inverse arithmetic energy scale.

D.1.3 Prime shifts as interaction vertices

Prime shift operators generate discrete transitions between arithmetic states. From a physical
viewpoint, these transitions resemble interaction vertices, where a state interacts with a prime
quantum.
Forward and backward prime shifts appear symmetrically, reflecting time-reversal or charge-
conjugation-type symmetry in the arithmetic dynamics.

D.1.4 Trace invariants as partition functions

The heat trace ( )
Θ(t) = Tr e−tHSMRK

admits an interpretation analogous to a partition function. It aggregates contributions from all
arithmetic states weighted by their effective energy.
Renormalized trace invariants thus play a role similar to thermodynamic potentials, encoding
global structural information rather than microscopic details.

197



D.1.5 Mellin transform and dual representations

The Mellin transform acts as a bridge between scale space and spectral space. In this respect it
is analogous to the Fourier transform linking time and frequency.
Reflection symmetry in Mellin space corresponds to a duality between small and large arithmetic
scales, reinforcing the interpretation of the construction as a scale-invariant or scale-dual system.

D.1.6 Comparison with quantum statistical systems

The SMRK Hamiltonian shares features with quantum statistical mechanical models, particularly
those based on discrete spectra and trace-class evolution operators. However, unlike thermal
systems, the arithmetic dynamics do not arise from probabilistic ensembles but from deterministic
multiplicative structure.
This distinction underscores the arithmetic nature of the construction despite the formal similarity
of the tools employed.

D.1.7 Universality and robustness

Many structural properties of the SMRK Hamiltonian, such as discreteness of the spectrum,
trace-class heat evolution, and stability under perturbations, are robust under modifications of
the model.
This robustness suggests that the observed features belong to a universality class of arithmetic
operators governed by multiplicative dynamics and renormalized traces, rather than to a finely
tuned construction.

D.1.8 Limits of physical analogy

While physical analogies provide intuition, they have clear limits. The SMRK Hamiltonian is
not derived from a physical system, nor does it describe physical particles or fields.
All analogies must therefore be understood as structural correspondences rather than literal
identifications.

D.1.9 Concluding perspective

The value of the SMRK framework lies in its synthesis of arithmetic structure, operator theory,
and renormalization. Physical analogies help illuminate this synthesis, but the mathematical
content stands independently of any physical interpretation.
In this sense, the SMRK Hamiltonian occupies a conceptual position analogous to that of spectral
geometry: a domain where analytic, algebraic, and structural ideas converge without being
reducible to any single interpretation.
